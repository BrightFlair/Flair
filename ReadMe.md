Flair is an SCSS product. To take advantage of it, use whatever SCSS parser you are comfortable with and import flair.scss into your existing stylesheet.

To tailor flair to your own needs, before importing it, you can define various variables used by flair:

* `$flair-variation`
	* `flair-full` to enable all of flair's features, or one or more of the following:
	* base
	* form
	* logo
	* nav
